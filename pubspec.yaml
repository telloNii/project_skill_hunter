  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Oxygen
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Oxygen-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Oxygen-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Oxygen-Light.ttf
          # style: italic
    - family: SourceSansPro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Light.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-BlackItalic.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-BoldItalic.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceSansPro-SemiBoldItalic.ttf
